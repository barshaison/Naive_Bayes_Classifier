# Naive_Bayes_Classifier
This is a school project I did in the course "Data Mining and Data Warehousing"

This is a generic Classifier based on "Naive Bayes" algorithm using m-estimator (m=2)

## Workflow
1. Constructing the structure of the model using Structure.txt file.
2. Data Pre-processing: 
    Data Cleaning: Fill in missing values, Identify outliers and smooth out noisy data (using the Equal-width Partitioning Discretization     Method) , Correct inconsistent data.
3. Loading the train set 
4. Building the classifier using the train set
5. Loading the test set
6. Classifying the records with Naive Bayes classifier using m-estimator (m=2)
